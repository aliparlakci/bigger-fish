We start the analysis with predicting the type of codec which the played video is encoded with. Predicting codec is a harder task then predicting the video player software. This can be explained such that because the task of decoding a video does not differ much from one codec to another. Whereas, each video player has unique implementations and it is easier to determine the type of the player using the interrupts they cause. Consequently, the accuracy of our model is relatively lower across experiments when predicting the codec, compared to the player type.

Analysis shows that media player, web browser and operating system have different effects on the accuracy. Operating system has little effect on the accuracy of the model. Windows 10, Linux 5 and macOS 13 had 40.05% (+/- 1.49), 46.01% (+/- 1.04) and 43.01% (+/- 1.32) Top-1 accuracy score, respectively. Also the low variance reassures that Random Forest Classifier is not overfitting and the accuracies are reliable.

However, type of the web browser which the malicios website is opened on does affect the results. It is observed that Firefox decreases the model's accuracy to 29% (+/- 1.73) while others have higher scores. Chrome and Safari performs similary with the accuracy scores of 51.34% (+/- 2.02) and 54.33% (+/- 2.97). Interestingly, Edge had lower accuracy result, 41.0 (+/- 2.41). Although, Edge and Chrome share the same browser engine, Chromium, developers of Edge browser made changes that mitigate interrupt-based side channel attacks. Moreover, we can see that Firefox also takes precautions to refrain from those attacks and they are successful. We believe that this is due to the resolution of the DOMHighResTimestamp object. Firefox has 2 milliseconds resolution whereas 1 millisecond accuracy. This affects the number of iterations of the attacker loop, thus resulting in a more precise fingerprinting. While other browsers does not disclose the resolution of those timestamps, we know that each has different implementations of this standard.

Type of the player affects the results as well. VLC (54.36% +/- 1.94) is observed to help the predictions more than MPV (40.25% +/- 0.91) and MPLAYER (41.62% +/- 2.21). While this phenomenon can be seen across different experiments, when the browser is Chrome and platform is Windows 10, it is non-existent. When predicting the codec using MPV and MPLAYER, the model was as successful as it was with VLC. Although we do not have a clear explanation to this behavior, analysis suggest that Chrome's Windows implementation is performant at creating fingerprints.
